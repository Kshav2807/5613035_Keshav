## Assignment 5 - Git Stash and Branch Flow

### Steps:
1. Create a new branch `featureOne`.
2. Edit a file inherited from `main`, make a commit.
3. Before the second commit, stash the changes using `git stash`.
4. Switch to `main` and create a new branch `featureTwo`.
5. Apply the stash using `git stash apply`.
6. Switch back to `featureOne`, apply stash again and drop it.
